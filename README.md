# Cobblify

A Hypixel BedWars quality-of-life mod for **Minecraft 1.8.9**, on **Forge** or **Lunar Client**, featuring several modules and a custom GUI.

Adheres to the [Hypixel Allowed Modifications](https://support.hypixel.net/hc/en-us/articles/6472550754962-Hypixel-Allowed-Modifications)
policy — no automation of player actions, no unfair advantages.

## Install

### Forge

1. Have a **Minecraft Forge 1.8.9** instance
2. Download the latest **`Cobblify-1.8.9-forge-<version>.jar`** from the
   [**Releases**](../../releases/latest) page.
3. Drop it into your instance's `mods/` folder.
4. Launch the game. Press **Right Shift** (or run `/cobblify`) to open the settings (bind can be changed in minecraft settings).

### Lunar Client

1. Download the **`Cobblify-Lunar-<version>`** bundle for your OS from the [**Releases**](../../releases) page (look for the latest `lunar-` release) and unzip it.
2. Double-click the installer (**`Install BedwarsQOL (Lunar).command`** on Mac, **`.bat`** on Windows). It copies the Weave loader + mod into place and prints a `-javaagent:` line.
3. In Lunar: Settings → turn on **Advanced Mode** → paste that line into **JVM Arguments** → save, pick **1.8.9**, and Play. Press **Right Shift** (or run `/cobblify`) in-game to open the settings.

**NOTE:** Stats and AntiSnipe need a one-time backend setup — see below (~5 minutes).

## Optional: enable Hypixel stats

Hypixel stats are served by a tiny **Cloudflare Worker you self-host** (free, private). Use the installer.

1. Run the installer for your OS (clone/download this repo, or get it from [**Releases**](../../releases/latest)):
   - **Windows:** double-click [`installers/setup-windows.bat`](installers/setup-windows.bat)
   - **Mac:** double-click [`installers/setup-mac.command`](installers/setup-mac.command)

2. Follow the prompts. A browser opens to log in or sign up for Cloudflare (free). If Cloudflare asks you to register a `workers.dev` name, type anything (e.g. your Minecraft name). The script deploys the Worker, locks it with a private token, and prints two chat commands (the first is copied to your clipboard).

3. In Minecraft, paste both commands into chat (`/cobblify statsurl ...` and `/cobblify statstoken ...`), then enable **Hypixel Stats** in the mod GUI (Right Shift).

That's it.

**Optional - Urchin cheater tags:** get a free API key from the Urchin Discord bot (`/grant`), then run `/cobblify urchinkey <your key>` in chat. Your key stays on your own Worker; the mod never holds it.
