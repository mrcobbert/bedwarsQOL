/**
 * Cheater Detector: flags OTHER players whose observed behaviour is impossible for a vanilla client.
 *
 * <p>Strictly passive — it only reads packets the vanilla client already receives, never sends or
 * alters anything, and its output is a private local chat line (click to prefill {@code /wdr}). All
 * detection math runs on raw packet values fed by {@code NetHandlerPlayClientMixin}, never on the
 * interpolated render entities (which lag the packets by a 3-tick lerp).
 *
 * <p>The checks are ports of the strongest open-source observer-side signals (see the project memory
 * for the full research): MWE's through-wall/autoblock/eat/noslow checks, plus an anti-knockback check
 * built on the fact that the server broadcasts the exact knockback impulse (S12) for every damaged
 * player. Attacks by other players are invisible as such — they are reconstructed by correlating an
 * attacker's arm-swing with the victim's hurt/crit packets in the same tick, and only when that
 * attribution is unambiguous (exactly one candidate swinger in range) does a combat check run.
 *
 * <p>Every check is a violation level with decay, and every threshold needs several independent events —
 * one packet can never flag. Teleports/rubber-banding (the #1 false-positive source per MWE's four-year
 * fix history), high victim latency, sneak edge-guards, and environmental damage all subtract or suspend
 * evidence rather than feed it. The module runs only inside an active Bedwars game and emits a private,
 * click-to-{@code /wdr} chat line — never a number, never an automated action.
