/**
 * Party Join Alert: prints a red {@code "Party Joined"} / {@code "Party Left"} to chat when a premade
 * team drops into — or pulls out of — your Bedwars pregame lobby.
 *
 * <p><b>The signal.</b> A party is teleported in (and pulled out) as one unit, so its members'
 * broadcasts all land in the same instant — joins as {@code "<name> has joined (n/m)!"}, leaves as
 * {@code "<name> has quit!"} or {@code "<name> disconnected."}. We count broadcasts that arrive
 * together — within {@link #BURST_TICKS} of each other — and alert when {@link #PARTY_MIN} or more land
 * at once. Solo queuers trickle in and out one at a time and never reach that count; two parties moving
 * in quick succession are separated by the gap between their bursts, so each fires its own alert. Joins
 * and leaves are tracked as separate bursts, so a leaving party and an arriving solo never merge.
 *
 * <p>(Since Hypixel's pregame name obfuscation the lobby hides every enemy's name and skin, so this
 * timing signal — who arrives/leaves together — is all we have; identity-based detection is impossible.)
 *
 * <p><b>Our own party.</b> When we queue with a premade, our party is teleported in as one unit too,
 * so our partymates' joins burst together exactly like an enemy party's would. The tell-apart signal is
 * our own join: it lands inside that same burst and no other. So rather than discard it, we use it to
 * tag the burst as ours and stay silent. An enemy party's burst never contains our join, so it is never
 * suppressed — the guard can't cause a missed alert. (A leaving party never carries our own quit — we
 * are gone before it broadcasts — so leave bursts are judged on size alone.)
 *
 * <p><b>Guards.</b> A burst containing our own join is suppressed, a "Sending you to …" teleport drops
 * any open burst, and we only run in the pregame waiting lobby. Chat and tick events both run on the
 * client thread (Hypixel re-queues chat packets onto it), so the burst state needs no synchronisation;
 * {@link WorldEvent.Load} resets as a safety net.
